The philosophy school that asserts that only humans are sentient beings is known as "human exceptionalism" or "humanism." Human exceptionalism emphasizes the unique cognitive and moral capabilities of humans, distinguishing them from other animals or entities. It maintains that humans possess qualities such as rationality, self-awareness, and moral agency that make them distinctively sentient beings. This perspective often highlights human beings as the central focus of moral consideration and assigns a special status to human life and flourishing. 

"I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
