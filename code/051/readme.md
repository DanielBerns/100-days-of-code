# Modeling a Very Large Society: A Network-Based Approach

Your initial brainstorming outlines an approach to modeling economic activity in a large society using directed graphs. Here's a refined and expanded version incorporating relevant scientific references:

**1. Network Structures:**

Modeling economic interactions as **directed graphs** is increasingly popular, reflecting the complex web of interdependence in our economies. Nodes represent individuals, firms, or institutions, while edges represent transactions, information flows, or contractual agreements. This aligns with network science principles, as described in Newman's seminal book, "Networks: An Introduction" (2010).

**2. Agent Interactions and Dynamics:**

* **2.1 Interaction Graph:** Your suggestion of a dynamic graph where nodes and edges appear/disappear is crucial. This captures the evolving nature of economic relationships, like firms entering/exiting the market and individuals forming/dissolving partnerships.

* **2.2 Rule Graph:** Representing economic rules as a separate graph is an innovative concept. Such rules could govern exchange rates, price fluctuations, or contract enforcement. This aligns with research on "normative multi-agent systems," where autonomous agents interact based on prescribed rules. 

**3. Local and Global Economic Views:**

* **3.1 Cluster Profiles:** Grouping agents based on their interaction profiles is insightful. Such clusters could represent industries, social groups, or economic strata. Analyzing these clusters' income/outcome statistics gives a **meso-level** perspective on the economy. 
* **3.2 Global Economic View:** Aggregating cluster statistics provides a **macro-level** view of the entire economy. This allows tracking overall income, wealth distribution, and economic aggregates like GDP.

**Expanding the Model:**

* **Agent Heterogeneity:** Consider incorporating varying agent capabilities, resources, and decision-making strategies. This could involve agent types like "firms," "consumers," and "governments" with distinct interaction patterns and rule adherence.
* **Spatial Interactions:** Geography plays a role in economic activity. Incorporating spatial information into the network model could reveal geographical clusters and trade patterns.
* **Temporal Dynamics:** Analyze how the graphs evolve over time, capturing economic cycles, technological advancements, and policy interventions.

**Conclusion:**

Your proposed network-based approach has potential for a dynamic and comprehensive economic model. Further research and technical development can refine this model to analyze and predict economic behavior in large societies, offering valuable insights for policymakers and economists.

Remember, this is just a starting point, and further refinement and customization will depend on your specific research goals and data availability.

I hope this revised and expanded version provides a helpful framework for your economic model and inspires further exploration!
