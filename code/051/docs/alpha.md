# Modeling a Very Large Society: A Network-Based Approach

This document outlines an approach to modeling economic activity in a large society using directed graphs.

**1. Network Structures:**

* **Economic interactions** as **dynamic directed graphs**: Nodes represent individuals, firms, or institutions, while edges represent interactions, transactions and information flows. 
A dynamic graph, where nodes and edges appear/disappear, captures the evolving nature of economic relationships, like firms entering/exiting the market and individuals forming/dissolving partnerships.

  abstract={Modeling the evolution of networks is central to our understanding of large 
  communication systems, and more general, modern economic and social systems. 
  The research on social and economic networks is truly interdisciplinary and the number of 
  proposed models is huge. In this survey we discuss a small selection of modeling approaches, 
  covering classical random graph models, and game-theoretic models to analyze the evolution of 
  social networks. Based on these two basic modeling paradigms, we introduce co-evolutionary 
  models of networks and play as a potential synthesis.},

* **Rules** as **dynamic directed graphs**: 
1. Nodes are variables, or functions; 
2. Edges represent relationships. 
3. Networks are rules for evaluation graph model rates, price fluctuations, and contract enforcement. 

**3. Local and Global Economic Views:**

* **3.1 Cluster Profiles:** We can group agents based on their interaction profiles. Such clusters could represent industries, social groups, or economic strata. Analyzing these clusters' income/outcome statistics gives a **meso-level** perspective on the economy.

* **3.2 Global Economic View:** Aggregating cluster statistics provides a **macro-level** view of the entire economy. This allows tracking overall income, wealth distribution, and economic aggregates like GDP.

**Expanding the Model:**

* **Agent Heterogeneity:** Consider incorporating varying agent capabilities, resources, and decision-making strategies. This could involve agent types like "firms," "consumers," and "governments" with distinct interaction patterns and rule adherence.

* **Spatial Interactions:** Geography plays a role in economic activity. Incorporating spatial information into the network model could reveal geographical clusters and trade patterns.

* **Temporal Dynamics:** Analyze how the graphs evolve over time, capturing economic cycles, technological advancements, and policy interventions.

**Conclusion:**

This network-based approach has potential for a dynamic and comprehensive economic model. 
Further research and technical development can refine this model to analyze and predict 
economic behavior in large societies, offering valuable insights for policymakers and economists.

Remember, this is just a starting point, and further refinement and customization will depend on your specific research goals and data availability.

I hope this revised and expanded version provides a helpful framework for your economic model and inspires further exploration!
