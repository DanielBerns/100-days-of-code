# Modeling a Very Large Society: A Network-Based Approach

This document outlines an approach to modeling economic activity in a large society using directed graphs.

**1. Network Structures:**

Modeling economic interactions as **directed graphs** is increasingly popular, reflecting the complex web of interdependence in our economies. Nodes represent individuals, firms, or institutions, while edges represent transactions, information flows, or contractual agreements. 

**2. Agent Interactions and Dynamics:**

* **2.1 Interaction Graph:** Your suggestion of a dynamic graph where nodes and edges appear/disappear is crucial. This captures the evolving nature of economic relationships, like firms entering/exiting the market and individuals forming/dissolving partnerships. 

* **2.2 Rule Graph:** Representing economic rules as a separate graph is an innovative concept. Such rules could govern exchange rates, price fluctuations, or contract enforcement. This aligns with research on "normative multi-agent systems," where autonomous agents interact based on prescribed rules. 

**3. Local and Global Economic Views:**

* **3.1 Cluster Profiles:** Grouping agents based on their interaction profiles is insightful. Such clusters could represent industries, social groups, or economic strata. Analyzing these clusters' income/outcome statistics gives a **meso-level** perspective on the economy. 
* **3.2 Global Economic View:** Aggregating cluster statistics provides a **macro-level** view of the entire economy. This allows tracking overall income, wealth distribution, and economic aggregates like GDP.

**Expanding the Model:**

* **Agent Heterogeneity:** Consider incorporating varying agent capabilities, resources, and decision-making strategies. This could involve agent types like "firms," "consumers," and "governments" with distinct interaction patterns and rule adherence.
* **Spatial Interactions:** Geography plays a role in economic activity. Incorporating spatial information into the network model could reveal geographical clusters and trade patterns.
* **Temporal Dynamics:** Analyze how the graphs evolve over time, capturing economic cycles, technological advancements, and policy interventions.
