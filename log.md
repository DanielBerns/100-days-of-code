# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I am an electronic engineer who develops software by trade. 
I wrote my first program in [GW-Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC), long time ago (during the past century!) During my long experience I have caught some bad habits I need to unlearn. I will try my 100 days of code for learning some good ones instead.

One of my bad habits is developing code without tests. So, I want to learn Test Driven Development (TDD).
I have noticed the wonderful Youtube channel by ArjanCodes, where these videos appear

10:00 AM - Today my work is: watch these videos, and write tests for some code.
