# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I am an electronic engineer who develops software by trade. 
I wrote my first program in [GW-Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC), long time ago (during the past century!) During my long experience I have caught some bad habits I need to unlearn. I will try my 100 days of code for learning some good ones instead.

## Day 0 - (20220801): Monday 1 August, 2022
One of my bad habits is developing code without tests. So, I want to learn Test Driven Development (TDD).
I have noticed the wonderful Youtube channel by ArjanCodes, where these videos appear

[How To Write Unit Tests For Existing Python Code // Part 1 of 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULxMQ57engo)

10:00 - Today my work is: watch these videos, and write tests for some code.
22:00 - I watched the videos, learned how to write tests. However, tests don't run properly.

## Day 1 - (20220802): Tuesday 2 August, 2022

Today I managed to refactor my code. Now, tests run, succeding and failing. However, I need to include assertions and use coverage.
